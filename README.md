#  Shooter (FPS Game)

> **Author:** Eugen Sulakov  
> *This is a robot shooter I originally wrote for my son about a year ago. At the time, everything was crammed into one long spaghetti script. Recently I decided to clean it up and turn it into a structured project.*

##  What is this?

A small 3D first-person shooter game written in **Python** using the **Ursina Engine**.  
The player controls a robot, shoots enemy bots, and progresses through levels.  
Each new level adds more enemies, and the game ends in victory after level 5.

##  Project Architecture

The code is modular and separated into logical components:

| File             | Purpose                                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `main.py`        | entry point                                  |
| `game_manager.py`| handles game lifecycle and restarts          |
| `shooter.py`     | player logic and level progression           |
| `enemy.py`       | enemy behavior                               |
| `bullet.py`      | bullet movement and collision handling       |
| `hud.py`         | user interface (text, buttons, messages)     |
| `scene.py`       | builds terrain, walls, and level boundaries  |
